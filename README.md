## Notes
As you can see, this theme uses images in the header of every post. <br>
If you don't have an image set and ready, you can select a placeholder image from unsplash that will show as background. <br>
To do this, use the **default card background image** under theme options. <br>  
You can find examples on how to set desired unsplash image or set of images that will change upon reloading on [unsplash](https://source.unsplash.com/)

## Basic usage instructions:

- Change the **logo** in **Themes Â» Casper 2**. <br>
- Change **social icons** by writing your **id** after the site name in the theme configuration. <br>
- Change the **favicon tagline** text there too. 

- Create a page of type : **blog** and go to **Advanced** in the admin.
- Under **`body-classes`** write **`home-template`**
- While you're there, in blog page 
    - Go to **content tab** 
    - Upload your own **primary Image** 
    - Hit **save**

The blog page should be blank, without any text.

Under **blog page** you can now create as many posts with __page template **`item`**__ as you want. <br> 
This is how you populate your blog.

In this theme you can also create a page of type : **archive**.
Pages with type **archive** will list all your posts written so far.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install casper

This will install the Gateway theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/casper`.

### Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `casper`.

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/casper
    
If you want to set Casper2 as the default theme, you can do so by following these steps:

* Navigate to `/your/site/grav/user/config`.
* Open the **system.yaml** file.

## Thank You

Grav has fantastic team, people that are very helpful and people that I probably bored to death,

but you guys helped to get most of the things right. So kudos to you. 

And at last, but not least - Thank You if you're using this theme. ðŸ™‚
